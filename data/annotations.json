  "2000" : "Stop and Frisk is a policy implemented in 1998 which allows police officers to stop, question, and frisk any individual who is suspected of committing a crime or looking as if they are about to commit one. In March of 2000, the Supreme Court stated that race, gender, clothing, and location of an invididual alone are not good enough reasons to stop and search someone, putting a dent in the program. All time high of police officers: 40,285.",
  "2001" : "The September 11 attacks hit the World Trade Center and the Patriot Act was enacted by congress as a response to prevent any future attacks on the nation. The act allowed for unprecedented surveillance on citizens and paved the way for stricter legislation to be passed in future years. Racially motivated hate crimes against Muslims had increased as a result of the attacks, raising tensions among neighborhoods in the city.",
  "2002" : "NYC defied a national trend and was one of the few major cities in which crime decreased compared to the previous year. This was despite a decrease in force size and spending due to budget redirection towards counter-terrorism measures. The NYPD commissioner at the time attributed the safer city to large busts in the drug trade and the confiscation of illegal firearms city-wide.",
  "2003" : "'Operation Impact', a program that saturates 61 high-crime areas with extra officers, was launched. In 2003, crime fell 32.7% in areas tagreted by the program; specifically, murder rate dropped by 38.8%, assaults have gone down by 33%, and rapes were decreased by 17.2%. There were some concerns that crime was simply pushed to other neighborhoods, however data refutes that claim.",
  "2004" : "In 2004, Congress passed the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act which allowed officers (retired or active duty) to be able to carry a firearm anywhere regardless of local law. The idea was to allow trained professionals to be able to protect the general public even when not on duty (especially in locations such as check-in counters and bus terminals).",
  "2005" : "The 2005 London bombings was one of the first cases in which NYPD detectives traveled out of the country to gather information regarding possible attacks on NYC. This marked one of the large turning points in the public eye, in which some began to question the power of the NYPD. These concerns came in a period of economic prosperity, in which the city was quickly developing and population was booming across the city.",
  "2006" : "In 2006, the NYPD was found guilty of using illegal ticket quotes - forcing officers to give out a certain amount of tickets per month or face consequences. 2006 also sparked concerns about firearm usage - in a released study, 156 officers were involved in a firearm-discharge incident in 2006, of which 47 incidents were ones in which the officer fired their weapon without being fired upon. This sparked review of the NYPD training meathods.",
  "2007" : "Due to recent backlash, the NYPD released a report titled 'Radicalization In the West: the Homegrown Threat', in which the spying and extreme survalience of Muslim communities is justified through claims of extremest propoganda making terrorits on 'home soil'. These claims and the release of this report did not fare ware, and recieved extreme backlash from the general population. Little was seemingly changed as a response to this release, however.",
  "2008" : "The police academy graduating class of 2008 was among the most educated in NYPD history. Nearly 25% of new officers had a four year degree - of those that graduated early in July, that number went up to 44%. This is due to the economic recession putting many educated individuals out of work, pushing them twoards government jobs. This increase also coincided with election season, in which politicians notably increase the size of the police force in an attempt to be hard on crime (and thus be more likely to be hired).",
  "2009" : "The Adrian Schoolcraft scandal rocked the NYPD; Mr. Schoolcraft had been secretly recording officer conversations from 2008 - 2009, and in October of '09 presented the tapes as evidence of corruption and wrongdoing in the department. It exposed the fact that arrest quotas were leading to officers making wrongful arrests while some crime went unreported in order to make the NYPD seem more effective. Although many news outlets picked up this story, little seemed to change after the tapes.",
  "2010" : "In 2010, internal reports were released to show that nearly 2,000 officers were arrested from 1992 - 2008, averaging 119 officers a year. Most of these offences were not M7, but rather were things like bribes, minor drug possession, etc... The report also highlighted a small agency (the NYPD Internal Affairs) tasked with finding and prosecuting officers who have committed crimes. This was among more concerns of crime statistic manipulation.",
  "2011" : "2011 marked the year with some of the most NYPD scandals in department history. There was a ticket-fixing scandal, in which 17 officers were accusing of fixing thousands of tickets, the drug planting scandal, in which narcotic detectives would plant drugs on innocent people to get a conviction, and a trafficking scandal, in which 12 officers were caught smuggling $1 million worth of firearms, cigarettes, and slot machines that were believed to all be stolen.",
  "2012" : "Whistleblower Craig Matthews filed a lawsuit against the NYPD because he claims he faced retaliation after he complained publicly about the department's use of an illegal quota system. Unlike before, this quota system included number of stop and frisks, most summonses, and most arrests. The lawsuit was later settled for $280,000 in 2015.",
  "2013" : "A report had exposed that in 2013 many retired NYPD and FDNY officers showed up for their psychiatric exams disheveled and disoriented, most following the same script. This was the beginning of a controversy in which retired officers had been coached on how to fail memory tests, feign panic attacks, and if the officers were on duty during 9/11, to talk about their fear of planes or entering skyscrapers. Almost $400 million was expected to have been stolen from the federal government, with these actions dating back to 1998.",
  "2014" : "The death of Eric Garner sparked massive outrage within the city - a video shows that Mr. Garner was walking down the street when an unmarked police car pulled up beside him. The officers attempted to restrain Mr. Garner and put him in a chokehold, killing the man. This sparked massive backlash against the NYPD, leading to mass protests across the city and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement within the city. This event was a turning point regarding citizen trust in the NYPD.",
  "2015" : "In a report released at the beginning of 2015, New York City was found to be the safest it ever was, with murder and robbery rates being the lowest they've been in 50 years (this is not even accounting for the increase in population during that time period). Most shootings were done by people with previous criminal backgrounds (nearly 84% of shooters have been previously arrested).",
  "2016" : "The shot-spotter system had gone into full effect - the system, modeled on Chicago's similar system, is able to detect when shots are fired accross the city and alert nearby officers as well as dispatchers where the crime is occuring. The system also has access to nearly 9,000 closed circuit TV cameras, 500 license plate readers, 600 radiation and chemical sensors to aid the NYPD in detecting and investigating crime.",
  "2017" : "2017 was the safest year the city had seen since 1951. There had been 290 murders in 2017, 45 less than in 2016, and a nearly a tenth of the 2,245 murders that occured in 1990; in 2017, the city had the lowest per-capita murder rate in 70 years. This was not without scandal, as the city announced a $75 million payout to settles a class-action lawsuit against the NYPD for issuing nearly 900,000 unlawful criminal summons."
