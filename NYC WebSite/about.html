    <h1> About this project </h1>
    <p> M7 refers to the NYPDâ€™s definition of the seven major felonies. These are: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, sexual assault, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny, and grand larceny of motor vehicle (grand theft auto). This visualization aims to show the change in frequency of these violations from 2000 to Present in New York City. The narrative for dozens fo years in NYC is that crime is consistently falling. While on a macro level this may be true, as NYC is a sprawling city of neighborhoods, we believe it is important to examine at this data on a more granular level. The question we really seek to answer is if crime is fundamentally decreasing or if crime is decreasing in such a way that it only benefits a select few.</p>
